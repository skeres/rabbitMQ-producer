     * A few valid routing key examples: "stock.usd.nyse", "nyse.vmw", "quick.orange.rabbit". There can be
     * as many words in the routing key as you like, up to the limit of 255 bytes.
     *
     * The binding key must also be in the same form. The logic behind the topic exchange is similar to a direct
     * one - a message sent with a particular routing key will be delivered to all the queues that are
     * bound with a matching binding key. However there are two important special cases for binding keys:
     * * (star) can substitute for exactly one word.
